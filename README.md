# Enigma Enc/decryptor Tool

##  **Description**

After studying the Enigma machine, i managed to develop a software using python language, that can simulate the mechanism of the machine, and encrypt the messages using rotors system.<br />
Enigma machine was used by Germans in World War II to encrypt the messages, and then send it to their troops using morse code.<br />
the machine uses three rotors and a plug board so you can encrypt the messages in one of 158 million million million possibilities, which was impossible to be cracked - until Prof. [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) did with his team in Bletchley Park -.<br />
In my model i only used the rotors mechanism so the number of possibilities has slightly decreased.
The encryption process in the machine is highly complicated that you can type the same letter 10 times in-a-row and it will be encrypted into 10 different letters.

##  **About Enigma machine**
Enigma is a highly complicated machine that can encrypt the message in one of 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 posibilities, it depends on three rotors and a plug board, with every click on a any letter the first rotor make a one letter rotation, every 26 rotations of the first rotor, the second rotor make a one letter rotation, every 26 rotations of the second rotor, the third rotor make a rotation, then the current pass from the button you pressed through the the current path through the rotors, then through the plug board, in whitch you can make the mapping between the letters changea again, making the number of posibilities way higher.<br />
the initial setting, or the key to encrypt the message is then the three initial letters in the three rotors, and the mapping between the letters on the plug board.

##  **How it works**
The UI has two text areas, you can enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt in the top input area, and then choose the initial settings, then you can press encrypt/decrypt button to find your encrypted message in the down box.
